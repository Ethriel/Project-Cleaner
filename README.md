 ## This little program can clean most of junk files in you projects' directories.
1. Close Visual Studio if it is opened. Select folder to work in. By default it is **%USERPROFILE%\source\repos**
2. If path is OK, the **Start** button will appear. Press it
3. After work is done a corresponding **message** will be shown also as **See results** button. Press it to open previously selected folder
## P.S.:
Yes, there is a **Clean Solution** option in VS  and yet, if you have like 10+ projects that were not cleaned and you need to free up some space will you clean them all **manually**? That is what this program for :)
